# pixel-cnn

Did this as part of Advance Deep Learning course. Model works on MNIST, so does not implement the convolutional masking across the channels. 

To train the model, run `python main.py` from the src folder. 

The plots and generated samples are saved in the `experiments` folder.

The paper does not explain the implementation properly, so I had to refer/borrow/steal ideas from these sources. Thanks to the authors!
